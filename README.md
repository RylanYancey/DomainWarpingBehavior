# A study of Domain Warping and how to use it. 

Domain Warping is a procedural generation technique that involves using the outputs of a noise function as the inputs for that same function. In our case, we are using the outputs of a Fractal Brownian Motion function as the inputs for an FBM function. Beneath the FBM, we are using Simplex Noise. 

# Simplex Noise

Everybody has heard of Perlin Noise, but Ken Perlin himself later revised and improved upon Perlin Noise with Simplex Noise.  Perlin Noise uses a regular graph to calculates gradients, but Simplex Noise uses a Simplex (triangular graph), which results in a massive computational improvement. 

A simplex noise function takes two values: an x, and a y. For example, pixels on an image.\

This image was generated by a Simplex Noise function.

# Fractal Brownian Motion

Before I go further, I think it is better for you to read this article than for me to explain it:https://thebookofshaders.com/13/.

TL;DR Fractal Brownian Motion combines _octaves_ number of waves into one wave using a _frequency_, _lacunarity_, and _persistence_. (sometimes amplitude but not if you are range-converting)
